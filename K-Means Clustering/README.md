# K-Means Clustering Project
📌 Project Overview

This project is part of my WGU Data Science Portfolio and demonstrates the implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm using Python. The notebook walks through the unsupervised learning process, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.

Tools Used:
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn

🔍 Workflow Summary
- Load and explore the dataset
- Preprocess the data (e.g., scaling, handling missing values)
- Determine the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow Method
- Apply the K-Means algorithm to segment the data
- Visualize the resulting clusters
- Interpret the clustering results and assess their validity

📁 File
- K-Means Clustering.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing the full pipeline from data preparation to model evaluation.

✅ Skills Demonstrated
- Unsupervised learning techniques
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Cluster analysis and interpretation
- Data visualization for cluster evaluation
- Use of scikit-learn for clustering tasks

📊 Dataset
- The dataset used in this notebook includes features suitable for clustering analysis.
- Details and the source of the data are described within the notebook itself.
