# Multiple Linear Regression Project

This project focuses on building and evaluating multiple linear regression models to predict continuous outcomes based on multiple predictor variables. It demonstrates the entire modeling process including data preprocessing, model fitting, diagnostics, and interpretation.

## 📋 Project Overview

- **Objective:**  
  To develop a multiple linear regression model that accurately predicts a target variable using several independent variables.

- **Key Tasks:**  
  - Data cleaning and preparation  
  - Exploratory data analysis to understand variable relationships  
  - Building and fitting the regression model  
  - Checking model assumptions and diagnostics (linearity, normality, multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity)  
  - Model evaluation using metrics such as R-squared and RMSE  
  - Interpretation of coefficients and overall model insights

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- statsmodels, scikit-learn  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository or project folder.  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
      jupyter notebook Multiple\ Linear\ Regression.ipynb
3. Run through the notebook cells to follow the data analysis, model building, evaluation, and interpretation steps.
