# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – Natural Language Processing Project

This project explores the use of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for natural language processing (NLP), specifically for predicting the next word in a sequence of text. RNNs are designed to work with sequential data, making them well-suited for language modeling and text generation tasks.

## 📋 Project Overview

- **Objective:**  
  To build and train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) capable of generating text by predicting the next word in a sequence using natural language input.

- **Key Tasks:**  
  - Preprocessing and tokenizing textual data  
  - Creating sequences and labels for supervised learning  
  - Building an RNN model using TensorFlow/Keras  
  - Training the model and monitoring performance  
  - Generating new text using the trained model

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- TensorFlow, Keras  
- Natural Language Toolkit (nltk)  
- matplotlib (for training visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook
