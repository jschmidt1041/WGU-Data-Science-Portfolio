# Decision Tree

📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my WGU Data Science Portfolio and demonstrates the implementation, evaluation, and visualization of a decision tree classifier. The notebook walks through the supervised learning process from data preprocessing to model interpretation.

Tools Used:
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn

🔍 Workflow Summary
- Load and explore the dataset
- Encode categorical variables and handle missing values
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train a decision tree classifier
- Evaluate performance (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)
- Visualize the decision tree structure using matplotlib
- Tune hyperparameters like max depth and criterion

✅ Skills Demonstrated
- Classification using decision trees
- Feature preprocessing (encoding, splitting, imputation)
- Model training and evaluation
- Visual interpretation of decision paths
- Use of scikit-learn for modeling and analysis

📊 Dataset
- The dataset used includes labeled features suitable for classification tasks. Further description and source are available within the notebook itself.
