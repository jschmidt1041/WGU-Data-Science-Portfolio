# Market Basket Analysis (MBA) Project

This project performs Market Basket Analysis using association rule mining to uncover interesting relationships and frequent itemsets within transactional data. The goal is to identify product combinations that customers often purchase together, which can be used to inform marketing strategies and product placements.

## 📋 Project Overview

- **Objective:**  
  To analyze transaction data for discovering frequent itemsets and association rules using the Apriori algorithm.

- **Key Tasks:**  
  - Data preprocessing and cleaning of transaction records  
  - Applying the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets  
  - Generating association rules based on support, confidence, and lift metrics  
  - Interpreting the rules to find actionable insights  
  - Visualizing results for clear communication

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- mlxtend (for Apriori and association rules)  
- matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook
