# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Project

This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a powerful dimensionality reduction technique, to explore and visualize high-dimensional data. PCA helps simplify complex datasets by identifying the directions (principal components) that maximize variance while minimizing information loss.

## üìã Project Overview

- **Objective:**  
  To perform PCA on a multivariate dataset in order to reduce dimensionality, visualize variance, and uncover meaningful data structure.

- **Key Tasks:**  
  - Standardizing features for PCA  
  - Computing principal components  
  - Evaluating explained variance  
  - Visualizing data in reduced dimensions  
  - Interpreting PCA results to draw insights

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn (for PCA and preprocessing)  
- matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository or project folder.  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Principal\ Component\ Analysis\ \(PCA\).ipynb
Run the notebook cells sequentially to load data, perform PCA, and interpret results.
