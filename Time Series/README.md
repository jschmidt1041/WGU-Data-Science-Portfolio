# ARIMA Time Series Modeling Project

This project demonstrates the use of the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to analyze and forecast time series data. It covers the full modeling pipeline, including data exploration, stationarity testing, parameter selection, model fitting, and forecasting.

## üìã Project Overview

- **Objective:**  
  To build a robust ARIMA model for forecasting future values of a time-dependent variable using historical data.

- **Key Tasks:**  
  - Visualizing and analyzing time series patterns  
  - Checking for and enforcing stationarity  
  - Identifying appropriate ARIMA(p,d,q) parameters  
  - Fitting the ARIMA model to training data  
  - Evaluating model performance  
  - Generating future forecasts and visualizing results

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- statsmodels (ARIMA implementation)  
- matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository or project folder.  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ARIMA\ Time\ Series\ Modeling.ipynb
3. Run through the notebook to:
- Load and inspect time series data
- Check for stationarity (e.g., using the ADF test)
- Select model parameters (using ACF and PACF plots)
- Fit the ARIMA model and forecast future values

- Stationarity testing (ADF test)
- Model selection with ACF/PACF
- ARIMA modeling (autoregression, differencing, moving average)
- Forecasting and residual diagnostics
