# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my WGU Data Science Portfolio and showcases Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques used to investigate data distributions, detect anomalies, identify patterns, and form hypotheses. EDA is a foundational step in the data science pipeline for understanding the data prior to modeling.

Tools Used:
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

🔍 Workflow Summary
- Load and inspect the dataset
- Assess data types and summary statistics
- Identify and handle missing values
- Analyze univariate distributions
- Perform bivariate and multivariate analysis
- Visualize relationships and trends
- Identify possible data issues and next steps for preprocessing

✅ Skills Demonstrated
- Descriptive statistical analysis
- Data profiling and summarization
- Use of visualizations to reveal patterns
- Python data visualization with seaborn and matplotlib
- Early-stage data quality assessment and insights generation

📊 Dataset
- The dataset used in this notebook is structured and includes both numerical and categorical features. Details and the source of the data are described within the notebook itself.

🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/jschmidt1041/WGU-Data-Science-Portfolio.git
   cd WGU-Data-Science-Portfolio/EDA/

2. Open the notebook:
   jupyter notebook "Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb"

3. Run all cells to walk through the EDA process.
