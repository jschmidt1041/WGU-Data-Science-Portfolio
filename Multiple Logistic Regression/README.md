# Multiple Logistic Regression Project

This project demonstrates the use of multiple logistic regression to model and predict categorical outcomes with more than two classes. It covers data preprocessing, model fitting, evaluation, and interpretation of logistic regression results.

## üìã Project Overview

- **Objective:**  
  To develop a multiple logistic regression model for multi-class classification and evaluate its performance.

- **Key Tasks:**  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing  
  - Exploratory data analysis for categorical and continuous variables  
  - Building and training a multiple logistic regression model  
  - Model evaluation using confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves  
  - Interpreting model coefficients and understanding variable impacts

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn, statsmodels  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository/project folder.  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Multiple\ Logistic\ Regression.ipynb
3. Execute the notebook cells step-by-step to explore the data, build the model, and analyze the results.
